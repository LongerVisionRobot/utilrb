=== Version 0.2.1
 * new features:
    - is_singleton?
    - inherited_enumerable (class_inherited_enumerable on steroids)
    - attribute() can be used in singleton classes (previously we had to 
      call class_attribute() in the class itself)
    - UnboundMethod#call(obj, *args, &block) calls the method on obj with 
      the provided arguments

 * changes:
    - changed semantics of Module::include for inclusion of modules in modules:
      the source_module::ClassExtension gets included in
      target_module::ClassExtension.  Previously, it was extending the target's
      singleton class. This way, Module really acts as a mixin for both class
      methods and instance methods

=== Version 0.1
 * Initial release
